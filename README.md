 YOLOv8 Phone & Reflection Detector

This project trains a custom YOLOv8 model to detect:  
-  **Phones** (front and back)  
-  **Phone Reflections in Eyes**  
-  **Background People (optional)**

It’s designed for monitoring scenarios where any phone presence—even via reflection—or people in the background should trigger an alert.


##  Features
 Detects **phones** even when only partially visible.  
 Identifies **reflections of phones in eyes**.   Optionally detects **people in the background** using YOLOv8 pretrained weights.  
 Real-time webcam monitoring.
